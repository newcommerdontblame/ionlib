ion RE Library
============== 

The purpose of ion RELib is to aid the development process by reducing boilerplate code.

This project is based off my old Voxation RE libraries (pretty much refactored in C++11), which is located [here](http://github.com/scen/Voxation).

I wanted to switch it up because I was unhappy with the clumsy nested namespaces and clunky inheritance. Progress will be pretty slow, because of school, programming contests and all that good stuff.

This library is built for Visual Studio 2012 (VS110)

Notes for future reference
--------------------------

* Refer to [this](http://code.google.com/p/v8/wiki/BuildingWithGYP) to build V8
    * Make sure to build using /MD (Multi Threaded DLL)
	* Make sure to ignore LIBCMT.lib in `preparser`
	* HandleScope will CRASH if done in a different thread, use v8::Locker. Intentional problem described [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/v8-users/FXpeTYuAqKI)
* How to build luabind
    * Build Lua using [this method](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6321927/compiling-lua-5-2-alpha-under-vs2010)
    * Get it off of [here](github.com/scen/luabind), bjam it up
        * This forked version is updated to Lua 5.2
		* Compile with exceptions
        * `bjam toolset=msvc release link=static exception-handling=on asynch-exceptions=off extern-c-nothrow=on`
		* How to make exceptions caught
			* Compile ionlib and your project with `/EHs`, which means extern functions CAN throw.
    * Set `LUA_PATH`, `BOOST_BUILD_PATH`, `PATH`, `BOOST_ROOT` accordingly.
* Luabind tutorial
    * http://blog.nuclex-games.com/tutorials/cxx/luabind-introduction/
* Replacing Lua with LuaJIT
	* They should have the same API
	* Follow instructions [here](http://luajit.org/install.html)
	* Build with `mscvbuild.bat static`. Link with `lua51.lib`
		* Edit `msvcbuild.bat` compile flags, add `/EHsc` for C++ exceptions (**IMPORTANT**)
